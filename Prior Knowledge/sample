Prior Knowledge
One should have knowledge on the following Concepts :

Supervised and unsupervised learning:

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained using unlabeled data.
Supervised learning model takes direct feedback to check if it is predicting correct output or not. Unsupervised learning model does not take any feedback.

Regression Classification and Clustering :

Regression and Classification are types of supervised learning algorithms while Clustering is a type of unsupervised algorithm.
When the output variable is continuous, then it is a regression problem whereas when it contains discrete values, it is a classification problem.

Artificial Neural Networks:

Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks or neural nets, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain

Convolution Neural Networks :

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images.
A CNN is a powerful tool but requires millions of labelled data points for training.

Flask :

Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco, develops it. 
Flask is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.
